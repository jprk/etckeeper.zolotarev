This is a suite of configuration files for zsh, that contain both general, and
site specific settings.  This package contains a directory called 'zsh' that
should be extracted into '/etc/', resulting in the following file structure:

	/etc/zsh/		the package
	/etc/zsh/zshenv
	/etc/zsh/zlogin
	/etc/zsh/zshrc
	/etc/zsh/site/
	/etc/zsh/site/zshenv
	/etc/zsh/site/zshrc

In addition to that you have to create the following links:

	/etc/zshenv -> /etc/zsh/zshenv
	/etc/zlogin -> /etc/zsh/zlogin
	/etc/zshrc -> /etc/zsh/zshrc

The directory zsh/home/ contains sample configuration files for a
specific user.
